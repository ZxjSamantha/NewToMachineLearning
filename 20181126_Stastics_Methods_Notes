Method = Model + Stratege + Algorithm

Model:
In supervised learning, model is the distribution of conditional probablity and decision function.

Stratege:
Typical method: 1)Regularization
                Add a regularizer or penalty term
                2)cross validation
                
What criterion we base on to choose model or learn the data:
1. loss function or cost function
   1) 
   2)
   3)
   4)log-likelihood loss function
  
Algorithm:
How to get the solution of algoritm
